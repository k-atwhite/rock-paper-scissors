// A game.js file that contains a Game class.
// A Game should include:
// A way to keep track of the selected game type
// Two Player instances
// A way to keep track of the data for the game board
// A way to keep track of which playerâ€™s turn it currently is
// A way to detect when a game is a draw (no one has won)
// A way to reset the Gameâ€™s board to begin a new game

// A way to check the Gameâ€™s board data for win conditions
// What does that mean??
