# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS!

## Project Overview
Project Goals:
* Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
* Iterate through/filter DOM elements using for loops
* Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
* Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - localStorage to persist data
  - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
